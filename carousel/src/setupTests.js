// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';


// The following import was used in previous versions of @testing-library/jest-dom.
// It has been commented out because, starting from version 6.0, the extend-expect entry point was removed.
// Instead, we use the default import which includes all necessary matchers.

// import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
